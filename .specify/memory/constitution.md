# Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

Every contribution must adhere to agreed formatting standards, utilize static analysis, maintain clear naming conventions, and ensure thorough documentation throughout the codebase. Code must be DRY, modular, and readable.

### II. Testing Standards

All code must be covered by automated unit and integration tests prior to merging. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged. Every feature and bugfix requires test cases covering edge scenarios and regressions.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User interfaces must provide consistent navigation, responsive layouts, predictable interaction patterns, and accessibility for all users. Design decisions should follow the shared UI/UX guidelines, ensuring uniform look and feel.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Implementations should optimize for fast load times, efficient resource utilization, and minimal latency. All changes must pass performance benchmarks and should not introduce measurable slowdowns or unnecessary bloat.

### V. Refactoring & Continuous Improvement

Continuous refactoring is expected to eliminate technical debt and embrace evolving best practices. All refactors must retain or improve quality and test coverage.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack must follow agreed standards. Security reviews are required for all dependencies and contributions. Deployment processes must include automated tests and rollbacks.

## Development Workflow

All changes require peer review and must pass all test suites and static analysis gates. No code is merged without documented test evidence and reviewer sign-off.

## Governance

This constitution takes precedence over all local practices. Amendments require collective agreement, documentation, and a migration plan.
